NewConsole is a mindustry mod adding a new console ui,
superior to that of the vanilla game.

Here, on the left side, is an output log.
Everything the game logs appears here. Additionally,
every executed script and its output i also sent here.
The scrollback is limited to 30000 characters
for performance reasons.

On the right side is a console input. The buttons above it
enable you to do the following things:

"run" -> execute the current script
"prev" -> view the previous script in the history
"next" -> view the next one or clear the input area
(scripts are saved to history when you run them or navigate in the history)
"scripts" -> view/run saved scripts or save the current one
"files" -> open the file browser
"events" -> view the script autorun menu
